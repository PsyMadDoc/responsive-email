        This is such a COOL email - if even features Rick and Morty dialogue!
      </h2>
      <p>
        Your failures are your own, old man! I say, follow throooough! Holy
        crap, Morty, run! Run for your life, Morty, run! I-I've never seen that
        thing before in my life, Morty, I don't even know what the hell it is!
        We-we gotta get out of here, Morty, it's gonna kill us! We're gonna die,
        Morty! We're gonna die! Well, she's my daughter, Summer. I outrank you.
        Or, family means nothing, in which case, don't play that card. My man!

          I mixed in some praying mantis DNA. You know a praying mantis is the
          exact opposite of a vole, Morty? They mate once and then bluergh cut
          each other's heads off. Life is effort and I'll stop when I die! Cool.
          Just stay in the driveway; the kill-bots are live, and I took you off
          the whitelist. Well I don't like your unemployed genes in my
          grandchildren, Jerry.

          It's been six hours. Dreams move one... one-hundredth the speed of
          reality, and dog time is one-seventh human time. So y'know, every day
          here is like a minute. It's like Inception, Morty, so if it's
          confusing and stupid, then so is everyone's favorite movie.

          Man, that guy is the Red Grin Grumbold of pretending he knows what's
          going on. Oh you agree huh? You like that Red Grin Grumbold reference?
          Well guess what, I made him up. You really are your father's children.
          Think for yourselves, don't be sheep. That, out there. That's my
          grave. On one of our adventures Rick and I basically destroyed the
          whole world. So we bailed on that reality and we came to this one.
          Because in this one the world wasn't destroyed. And in this one, we
          were dead. So we came here a-a-and we buried ourselves and we took
          their place. And every morning, Summer, I eat breakfast 2 Come on,
          flip the pickle, Morty. You're not gonna regret it. The payoff is
          huge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prepare to be emancipated from your own inferior genes! It probably
          has space aids. What about the reality where Hitler cured cancer,
          Morty? The answer is: Don't think about it. Pluto's a planet.
